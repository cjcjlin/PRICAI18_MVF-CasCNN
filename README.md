Dependencies
----
Python 2.7ï¼Œ Tensorflow 1.1.0, openslide-python 1.1.1, scikit-image 0.13.0, scipy 1.1.0, numpy 1.13.1, matplotlib 2.0.2.

Data Preparation
----
Our benchmark dataset is from [Camelyon16 Challenge](https://camelyon16.grand-challenge.org/). You can download the dataset from this [link](https://camelyon16.grand-challenge.org/Download/).

Quick Start
----
This code is mainly for testing. You can run the inference on testing dataset as follows:
1. We firstly utilize LVF-CNN (large visual field CNN) to coarsely locate the possible lesion areas. So to obtain LVF patches, please run **pathology_divide_test40X1196.py** to preprocess testing slides and divide them into patches.

2. Please run **pathology_test_tfrecords.py** to convert image patches to [tfrecord format](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/python_io). You may find more useful information from this [link](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/reading_data).

3. Please run **pathology_test_test.py** to create the initial LVF heatmaps. Also, don't forget to set your own paths in **pathology_test_preprocessing.py** and **pathology_test_eval.py**. 

4. To get the final LVF heatmaps, please run **UpsampleLVFHeatmap.py**.

5. Subsequently, we leverage these LVF heatmaps to generate small visual field patches. Please run **pathology_generate_tumor_candidate.py**. Then, use **pathology_test_tfrecords.py** to convert patches to tfrecord format and run **pathology_test_test.py** to produce the final MVF-CNN heatmaps. You can adopt **SaveHeatmapToFig.py** to visualize these heatmaps.

6. Finally, please utilize **Evaluating_AUC.py** and **Evaluating_FROC.py** to measure the performance.
